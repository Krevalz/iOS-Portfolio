iOS-Development
===============
>This repository holds all of my projects based on iOS mobile applications.

After taking a few computer science courses in college, I knew the fundamentals of writing code but never had a way to visualize or interact with my code. I then stumbled upon Xcode, Swift and an iOS development course on Udemy taught by Mark Price and his team at **Devslopes**. All the projects I have complete from this course can be found below as well as screenshots. 

Once I finished my Udemy course, it was time to further develop my skills. I got together with my buddies [Aman Ketebo](https://github.com/amanketebo) and [Danny Pecoraro](https://github.com/dannyjp) who were also interested in iOS development and formed a group called **SinCityDev**. We met up every weekend with projects in mind to see if we had what it takes to develop them. Those projects can also be found below.

Algorithm Practice
==================
In order to become good at programming, a programmer should be able to problem solve and develop algorithms to solve a task. Swift playground is a great candidate for practicing these skills. In the [AlgorithmPractice](AlgorithmPractice) folder, I used Swift playgrounds to solve common whiteboard questions. I also practice HigherOrderFunctions and Swift shorthand to improve my knowledge of Swift in order to become better at creating iOS applications.
